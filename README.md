## Installation

Download the extension here for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/netflix-prime-auto-skip/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflixprime-auto-skip/akaimhgappllmlkadblbdknhbfghdgle).
<br>
Android: Download [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser) or similar to be able to install the chrome addon. But only Amazon prime can be watched on android in the Browser.

It will work with other skippers, but it may behave unexpectedly.

## What it does

The script, "skipper.js", is injected into all urls containing "amazon.\*/\*/video" or "netflix.com".

It automatically skips Ads, intros, Credits, recaps, and anything else you don't want to watch on Netflix and Prime video.

## How it works

The addon is observing every mutation of the dom Tree of the Website.

On Netflix it matches the buttons with the data-uia tag containing:

* Intro: player-skip-intro
* Recap: player-skip-recap, player-skip-preplay
* Credits: next-episode-seamless-button
* Inactivity Warning: interrupt-autoplay-continue
* Basic tier ads: matched by css class .ltr-puk2kp and the speed is set to 16x until the ad is over

On Prime video it matches buttons with the Css Classes:

* Intro: skipelement
* Credits: nextupcard-button
* Self promoting ads: .fu4rd6c.f1cw2swo
* Paid Content: .o86fri (yallow text indicates paid films)
  
The freevee ad text contains the ad length which is matched by 

* Freevee ads: .atvwebplayersdk-adtimeindicator-text

and then skipped by forwarding by the ad length -1 second which will fix a lot of issues.

definetly available in Country: USA e.g.

### Steps
For each feature you want added, create a page snapshot with the add-on Single File ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle) [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/)) and attach the files to the issue.

Features that require a snapshot with single file:
* Home Page
* Skip intro button is showing
* Skip Credits card/button is showing
* Subtitles if they need improving

Any other feature you want added like ads e.g.

ACC: may need to give me an account temporarily to verify it's working, because just doing it with the template doesn't show many many bugs.
